        Hello Everyone, my name is Emeka Thomas Onwugbonu, I was born and raised
        in Port Harcourt, in the oil rich region of southern Nigeria. I aspire
        to be a fullstack software developer, that is why I am presently
        enrolled in the Web and Computer Programming course at BYU Idaho. I am a
        father of Three energetic children.
