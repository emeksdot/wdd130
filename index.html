        Hello Everyone, my name is Emeka Thomas Onwugbonu, I was born and raised
        in Port Harcourt, in the oil rich region of southern Nigeria. I aspire
        to be a fullstack software developer, that is why I am presently
        enrolled in the Web and Computer Programming course at BYU Idaho. I am a
        father of Three energetic children.

        Rivers State is in the Oil-rich southern part of Nigeria. It is home to
        many Multinational oil firms like the Anglo-Dutch company Shell, Italian
        Agip and the french owned TotalFinaElf. Its capital, Port Harcourt is
        the most populous city in the South-South geo-political division of the
        country. I was born and raised here.It is bounded on the south by the
        Atlantic ocean.
